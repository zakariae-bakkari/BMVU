## 📖 About

BMVU (Block Manuel de Voie Unique) is an interactive simulation of the railway signaling system used by ONCF (Office National des Chemins de Fer du Maroc). This educational application was developed as an internship project at ONCF AGDAL under the supervision of experienced railway engineers.

## 🎯 Features

- **Realistic Simulation**: Faithful interface to the BMVU system used by ONCF
- **Communication Procedures**: Simulation of communication procedures between stations
- **Authority Management**: Circulation authority management
- **Semaphores and Signaling**: Interactive semaphore and signaling system
- **Educational Value**: Learn railway safety principles without risk
